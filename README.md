# Wordle Solver
This was a solo project I created once I learned React. The deployed link is https://wordle-solver-three.vercel.app/

I created this project in about 4 hours. It works well, but isn't updated automatically.

Future additions I'd like to add:
Error handling when a user has a letter selected and then adds it to the black-letters, the selected letter should disappear. Currently users can break the intended functionality of the app if they make those operations in order.

Auto-updating word of the day from Wordle to slowly remove used answers from the list if desired.
